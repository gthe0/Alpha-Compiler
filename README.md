# HY340 - PHASE 3

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of a compiler using Flex and Bison/YACC for the Alpha programming language.
We generate the Intermidiate Representation (IR) based on the specifications given to us and Syntax-directed translation.

## Project Contents

- `parser.y`: YACC file with the Grammar rules and error checks.
- `lex.l`: Lexical analyzer specification file.
- `src`: The folder with all the .c source files.
- `include`: The folder with all the include files i.e. header (.h) files.
- `scripts`: The folder with all the scripts used.
- `Makefile`: Contains instructions for building the project.

## Building and Running

To build the project, run the following command:
- make all

To run the parser on an input file, use the following command:
- ./bin/parser.out INPUT_FILE

This will generate a file called quads.txt containing the IR. If any error was encountered during the IR generation, this file will not be produced at all.

If you want to see the symbol table entries, run it with the flag -s e.g:
- ./bin/parser.out -s INPUT_FILE

This will also generate a file called sym_table.txt

INPUT_FILE: File containing the input (It's self explanatory).

If no input file is specified, the program will halt its execution immediately !

## Cleaning

To Clean the project, run the following command:
- make clean (This will delete all files and folders generated by other make rules)

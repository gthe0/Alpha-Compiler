# HY340 - PHASE 5

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of a compiler using Flex and Bison/YACC for the Alpha programming language.
Here, we generate the Alpha binary based on the IR generation.

## Project Contents

- `parser.y`: YACC file with the Grammar rules and error checks.
- `lex.l`: Lexical analyzer specification file.
- `src`: The folder with all the .c source files.
- `include`: The folder with all the include files i.e. header (.h) files.
- `scripts`: The folder with all the scripts used.
- `Makefile`: Contains instructions for building the project.

## Building and Running

To build the project, run the following command:
- make all

To run the parser on an input file, use the following command:
- ./bin/parser.out INPUT_FILE

This will generate a file called a.abc containing the Alpha Binary which can be executed by the Alpha Virtual machine.

If you want to see the symbol table entries, run it with the flag -s e.g:
- ./bin/parser.out -s INPUT_FILE

It generate a file called sym_table.txt

if you want to see the quads produced (meaning the IR), pass the flag -q e.g:
- ./bin/parser.out -q INPUT_FILE

It generate a file called quads.txt

If you want to see the tcg result, pass the flag -i like this:
- ./bin/parser.out -i INPUT_FILE

It generate a file called tcg_instructions.txt

Lastly, you can pass the flag -o to change the name of the ouput binary file and you can also pass -Ox for various optimization levels(Note: O1 was deprecated due to lack of time. You can use O2 and O3. If you pass O3, you ll be warned that peephole and code transfromation optimizations were deprecated)

In each case, the INPUT_FILE is the file containing the source code to be compiled (It's self explanatory).

If no input file is specified, the program will halt its execution immediately !

## Cleaning

To Clean the project, run the following command:
- make clean (This will delete all files and folders generated by other make rules)

## Project Contents

- `parser.y`: YACC file with the Grammar rules and error checks.
- `lex.l`: Lexical analyzer specification file.
- `src`: The folder with all the .c source files.
- `include`: The folder with all the include files i.e. header (.h) files.
- `scripts`: The folder with all the scripts used.
- `Makefile`: Contains instructions for building the project.

## Building and Running

To build the project, run the following command:
- make generate (This will generate the lexer code from `lex.l` and the yacc/bison code from `parser.y`)
- make compile (This will compile all the `.c` files, and link them into an executable named `parser.out`.)

To run the parser on an input file, use the following command:
- ./bin/parser.out INPUT_FILE

INPUT_FILE: File containing the input (It's self explanatory). If no input file is specified, the program will terminate.

If no input file is specified, the program will halt its execution immediately !

If you want to generate an output file, please use either command:
- ./bin/parser.out INPUT_FILE OUT_FILE
- ./bin/parser.out INPUT_FILE > OUT_FILE

OUT_FILE: File where the output will be written

## Cleaning

To Clean the project, run the following command:
- make clean (This will delete all files and folders generated by other make rules)

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of a lexical analyzer using FLEX.

## Project Contents

- `lex.l`: Lexical analyzer specification file.
- `al.h`, `alpha_token.h`: Libraries.
- `al.c`: Implementation of a "printer".
- `alpha_token.c`: Contains list implementation (create, insert, print) and basic struct.
- `Makefile`: Contains instructions for building the project.

## Building and Running

To build the project, run the following command:
- make flex (This will generate the lexer code from `lex.l`)
- make compile (This will compile all the `.c` files, and link them into an executable named `scanner.out`.)

To run the lexical analyzer on an input file, use the following command:
- ./bin/scanner.out INPUT_FILE

INPUT_FILE: File containing the input (It's self explanatory). If no input file is specified, the program will terminate.

If you want to generate an output file, please use either command:
- ./bin/scanner.out INPUT_FILE OUT_FILE
- ./bin/scanner.out INPUT_FILE > OUT_FILE

OUT_FILE: File where the output will be written

## Cleaning

To Clean the project, run the following command:
- make clean (This will delete all files and folders generated by other make rules)
